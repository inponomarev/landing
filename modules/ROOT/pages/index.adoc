== University lecturer & tutor in Software Engineering with solid practical background

image::ivan.jpg[width="200" role="related thumb left"]

Software engineering and teaching are the two biggest passions in my life.
I{nbsp}teach students what I do on a daily basis, what the industry will require of them and what I{nbsp}lacked when I{nbsp}studied at the university.

I{nbsp}strive to instill a love for and deep understanding of the craft of software development, with all its trade-offs and imperfections, utilizing up-to-date tools and techniques.

My competencies include Java, Kotlin, software testing, and QA.

When talking about JVM languages, I prefer to dive deep in advanced topics, including https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMbZm_r52Ho[icon:youtube[]{nbsp}generics], functional style programming, concurrency (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYSB3faBSrI[icon:youtube[]{nbsp}lecture{nbsp}1], https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOTfCDdzdyU[icon:youtube[]{nbsp}lecture{nbsp}2]), annotations processing etc. I also practice OSS contribution with students. Projects being maintained under my supervision include https://github.com/atp-mipt/ljv[ljv] and https://github.com/fppt/jedis-mock[jedis-mock].
